   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/markcoleman/Aggregator-the-agitator/security)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the security advisory form

2. **Email (Alternative)**
   - Send details to: security@[project-domain].com
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Encrypt your message using our PGP key if possible

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or demonstration (if applicable)
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for a fix
- **CVE Information**: If you've obtained a CVE number

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding quickly to security reports:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (varies by complexity)

### Security Update Process

1. **Vulnerability Assessment**: We evaluate the severity and impact

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

- **Secure Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Logging**: Log security events but avoid logging sensitive data
- **Testing**: Include security test cases
- **Code Review**: Review all security-related changes

### For Deployment

- **Environment Variables**: Store secrets in environment variables
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
- **Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious activity
- **Updates**: Keep the application and dependencies updated
- **Backup**: Maintain secure backups of critical data
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls

### For Users

- **JWT Security**: Protect JWT tokens and rotate them regularly
- **Scope Minimization**: Request only necessary scopes
- **Token Expiry**: Use appropriate token expiry times
- **Client Security**: Secure your client applications
- **Monitoring**: Monitor API usage for anomalies

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Report vulnerabilities privately first
2. **Coordination**: Work with us to assess and fix the issue
3. **Public Disclosure**: Coordinate public disclosure timing
4. **Credit**: Receive proper credit for the discovery

### Public Disclosure

We will publicly disclose vulnerabilities:

- **After Fix**: Only after a fix is released
- **With Credit**: Giving proper credit to the reporter
- **With Details**: Including appropriate technical details
- **With Timeline**: Explaining the resolution timeline
